## Introduction

EdgeMesh, as the data plane component of the [KubeEdge](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge) cluster, provides simple service discovery and traffic proxy functions for applications, thereby shielding the complex network structure in edge scenarios.

### Background

KubeEdge is build based on [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes), extending cloud-native containerized application orchestration capabilities to the edge. However, at the scenario of edge computer, the network topology is more complex. Edge nodes in different areas are often not interconnected, and the inter-communication of traffic between applications is the primary requirement of the business. For this scenairo, EdgeMesh offers a solution.

### Why EdgeMesh?

EdgeMesh satisfies the new requirements in edge scenarios (e.g., limited edge resources, unstable edge cloud network, complex network structure, etc.), that is, high availability, high reliability, and extreme lightweight:

- **High availability**
  - Use the capabilities provided by LibP2P to connect the network between edge nodes
  - Divide the communication between edge nodes into intra-LAN and cross-LAN
    - Intra-LAN communication: direct access
    - Cross-LAN communication: when the hole punching is successful, a connection channel is established between the Agents, otherwise it is forwarded through the Server relay
- **High reliability (offline scenario)**
  - Metadata is distributed through the KubeEdge edgehub/cloudhub tunnel, no need to access the cloud apiserver
  - EdgeMesh integrates a lightweight node-level DNS server, service discovery no longer accesses the cloud CoreDNS
- **Extreme lightweight**
  - Each node has one and only one Agent, which saves edge resources

**User value**

- Enable users to have the ability to access edge-to-edge/edge-to-cloud/cloud-to-edge applications across different LANs
- Compared to the mechanism of CoreDNS + Kube-Proxy + CNI service discovery, users only need to simply deploy an Agent to finish their goals

## Architecture

![image](./docs/.vuepress/public/images/advanced/em-arch.png)

The above figure shows a brief overview of the EdgeMesh architecture, EdgeMesh contains edgemesh-server and edgemesh-agent.

The core components of edgemesh-server include:

- **Tunnel-Server**: Based on [LibP2P](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p), establish a connection with edgemesh-agent to provide relay capability and hole punching capability

The core components of edgemesh-agent include:

- **Proxier**: Responsible for configuring the kernel's iptables rules, and intercepting requests to the EdgeMesh process
- **DNS**: Built-in DNS resolver, which resolves the DNS request in the node into a service cluster IP
- **Traffic**: A traffic forwarding module based on the Go-Chassis framework, which is responsible for forwarding traffic between applications
- **Controller**: Obtains metadata (e.g., Service, Endpoints, Pod, etc.) through the Local APIServer capability on the edge side of KubeEdge
- **Tunnel-Agent**: Based on LibP2P, using relay and hole punching to provide the ability of communicating across subnets
